    <h1>Simz Exercise Example</h1>
    <!--added paragraph to explain what this project is all about-->
    <p>So in this example the aim is to link my local repository to my remote repository. Best of luck to me and I aim to make use of the git commands I learnt today.</p>
    <!--So i've decided I am going to document-->
    <p>So it has been such a long day gathering the basics of <a href="#HTML">HTML</a> important tags along <a href="#git">git</a> commands. <br>Overall it has been a great day gathering knowledge and the best chair I can effectively work on.<br>Hehehe what started as a programming journey that was uhm somewhat eh but now I am very pleased by where we are, be it binary numbers, hexidecimal and octal it is all good now. Hopefully as my skill increases so will this website and the day it is deployed it should somewhat be beneficial to an upcomming Software Developer hehehe.</p>
